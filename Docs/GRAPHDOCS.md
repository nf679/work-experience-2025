## Usage
### Limits  
Under the graph there are 2 inputs labelled X and Y.  
These dictate the position of the 2 lines on the graph with X corresponding to the vertical line and Y corresponding to the horizontal line.  
These lines can be used to see which group workspaces are above a certain heat or size

### Other Features  
You can hover over each point to see the exact values and the origin of that data point.
